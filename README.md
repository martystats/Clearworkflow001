**Data Cleaning to Clustering – Health Data ML Portfolio**

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data science workflow using real-world health data involving children under age 18. The notebook covers the following key steps:

---

## Project Overview

- **Domain**: Healthcare
- **Goal**: To clean and analyze health conditions data and apply unsupervised machine learning (KMeans) to discover patterns.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

---

## Workflow Breakdown

### Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.
- Renamed columns for clarity.

### Step 2: Data Visualization
- Used bar charts, violin plots, and scatter plots to understand distributions and relationships.

### Step 3: Feature Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize numeric features for clustering.

### Step 4: Clustering with KMeans
- Applied KMeans algorithm to group data into clusters.
- Visualized results with color-coded clusters.

### Step 5: Cluster Center Extraction
- Transformed cluster centers back to original scale.
- Visualized clusters with their respective centroids.
